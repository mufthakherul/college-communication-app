## ⏸️ Optional Services - NOT MIGRATED

These services are still using Supabase but are **optional** and don't block core functionality:

### Analytics Service ⏸️
**File:** `apps/mobile/lib/services/analytics_service.dart`  
**Status:** Uses Supabase Edge Functions  
**Impact:** Non-critical - analytics can be added later or removed

**Affected Features:**
- User activity tracking
- Admin analytics dashboard
- Performance metrics

**Recommendation:** Can be disabled or migrated to Appwrite Functions later

### Other Services (No Migration Needed) ✅

The following services don't use backend and work as-is:
- ✅ `cache_service.dart` - Local caching
- ✅ `connectivity_service.dart` - Network detection
- ✅ `demo_mode_service.dart` - Demo mode
- ✅ `theme_service.dart` - Theme management
- ✅ `offline_queue_service.dart` - Offline operations
- ✅ `mesh_network_service.dart` - P2P networking
- ✅ `background_sync_service.dart` - Background sync
- ✅ Others (sentry, onesignal, etc.) - 3rd party integrations

## 🎯 What Works Right Now

After completing the Appwrite database setup, you can:

1. **User Authentication** ✅
   - Register new users
   - Sign in/out
   - Manage profiles

2. **Notices** ✅
   - Create announcements
   - View all notices
   - Filter by type
   - Real-time updates

3. **Messaging** ✅
   - Send messages
   - View conversations
   - Mark as read
   - Unread counts

4. **Offline Features** ✅
   - All offline/mesh networking features work independently
   - Demo mode works

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. Real-time Updates
- Using **polling** (every 3-5 seconds) instead of WebSockets
- Works well but slightly delayed compared to native WebSocket support
- Can be upgraded to Appwrite Realtime API later if needed

### 2. Analytics Disabled
- Analytics service still references Supabase
- Will not work until migrated to Appwrite Functions
- Non-critical - app works without it

### 3. Queries
- Some complex queries simplified due to Appwrite's NoSQL nature
- All core functionality preserved
- May need optimization for large datasets

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Created
- ✅ `apps/mobile/lib/appwrite_config.dart` - Your project configuration
- ✅ `apps/mobile/lib/services/appwrite_service.dart` - Appwrite SDK wrapper

### Updated
- ✅ `apps/mobile/pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies changed
- ✅ `apps/mobile/lib/main.dart` - Initialization updated
