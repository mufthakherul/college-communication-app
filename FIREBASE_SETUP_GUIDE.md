# Firebase Setup Guide for RPI Communication App

## üî• Connecting Your App to Firebase

The app code is complete, but it needs to be connected to a Firebase project to work. This guide will walk you through the setup process.

## Why Firebase Connection is Needed

Your app uses Firebase for:
- **Authentication** - User login/registration
- **Firestore Database** - Storing notices, messages, user profiles
- **Cloud Storage** - Storing uploaded files and images
- **Cloud Functions** - Backend business logic
- **Cloud Messaging** - Push notifications

Currently, the app has placeholder configuration values that need to be replaced with your actual Firebase project details.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:
- A Google account
- Node.js and npm installed
- Firebase CLI installed: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Flutter installed (for running `flutterfire configure`)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create a New Project:**
   - Click "Add project"
   - Project name: `rpi-communication` (or your preferred name)
   - Click "Continue"
   - Disable Google Analytics (optional, can enable later)
   - Click "Create project"
   - Wait for project creation (takes ~1 minute)

### Step 2: Enable Firebase Services

Once your project is created:

#### 2.1 Enable Authentication

1. In Firebase Console, click "Authentication" in left menu
2. Click "Get started"
3. Go to "Sign-in method" tab
4. Enable "Email/Password" provider
5. Click "Save"

#### 2.2 Create Firestore Database

1. Click "Firestore Database" in left menu
2. Click "Create database"
3. Select "Start in production mode" (we'll deploy security rules later)
4. Choose a location (select closest to Bangladesh, e.g., asia-south1)
5. Click "Enable"

#### 2.3 Enable Cloud Storage

1. Click "Storage" in left menu
2. Click "Get started"
3. Start in production mode
4. Use same location as Firestore
5. Click "Done"

#### 2.4 Enable Cloud Functions

1. Click "Functions" in left menu
2. Click "Get started"
3. Upgrade to Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go, has free tier)
   - Note: Free tier includes 2M function invocations/month
   - You won't be charged unless you exceed free limits

### Step 3: Configure Your App

#### Option A: Using FlutterFire CLI (Recommended)

1. **Install FlutterFire CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase:**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Configure your Flutter app:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   flutterfire configure
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Select platforms: Android (and iOS if needed)
   - Choose the package name: `gov.bd.polytech.rgpi.communication.develop.by.mufthakherul`
   
5. **This will:**
   - Generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` with real values
   - Download `google-services.json` for Android
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS

#### Option B: Manual Configuration

If FlutterFire CLI doesn't work, you can configure manually:

##### For Android:

1. **In Firebase Console:**
   - Click gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí Project settings
   - Scroll to "Your apps" section
   - Click Android icon to add Android app
   
2. **Register app:**
   - Package name: `gov.bd.polytech.rgpi.communication.develop.by.mufthakherul`
   - App nickname: "RPI Communication Android"
   - Click "Register app"

3. **Download config file:**
   - Download `google-services.json`
   - Place it in: `apps/mobile/android/app/google-services.json`

4. **Update firebase_options.dart:**
   - Get values from Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí General
   - Update the `android` configuration in `firebase_options.dart`

### Step 4: Deploy Backend

1. **Set Firebase project:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/college-communication-app
   firebase use --add
   # Select your project and give it an alias (e.g., 'default')
   ```

2. **Update .firebaserc:**
   ```json
   {
     "projects": {
       "default": "your-project-id"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build TypeScript:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Deploy Firestore Rules:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

6. **Deploy Storage Rules:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only storage:rules
   ```

7. **Deploy Cloud Functions:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

### Step 5: Test Your Connection

1. **Build and run the app:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Test user registration:**
   - Open the app
   - Click "Register"
   - Enter name, email, password
   - Click "Create Account"
   - If successful, you'll be logged in!

3. **Verify in Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - You should see your new user listed

## üéØ Quick Setup Script

For faster setup, you can use this script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Quick Firebase Setup Script
echo "üî• Firebase Setup for RPI Communication"

# 1. Login to Firebase
firebase login

# 2. Set project (you'll need to select your project)
firebase use --add

# 3. Configure Flutter app
cd apps/mobile
flutterfire configure
cd ../..

# 4. Install and build functions
cd functions
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# 5. Deploy everything
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules,functions

echo "‚úÖ Setup complete!"
echo "üì± You can now run: cd apps/mobile && flutter run"
```

Save this as `setup-firebase.sh` and run:
```bash
chmod +x setup-firebase.sh
./setup-firebase.sh
```

## üîç Verification Checklist

After setup, verify:

- [ ] `apps/mobile/android/app/google-services.json` exists
- [ ] `apps/mobile/lib/firebase_options.dart` has real values (not 'YOUR_API_KEY')
- [ ] Firebase Console shows your project
- [ ] Authentication is enabled in Firebase Console
- [ ] Firestore database is created
- [ ] Storage bucket is created
- [ ] Functions are deployed (check Firebase Console ‚Üí Functions)
- [ ] Security rules are deployed

## üì± Testing the App

Once Firebase is connected:

1. **Build APK:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

2. **Install on device:**
   - APK will be at: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
   - Transfer to Android device and install

3. **Test features:**
   - Register a new user
   - Login with credentials
   - Create a notice (if you're admin/teacher)
   - Send a message
   - View profile

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "Firebase not initialized"
- Make sure `google-services.json` is in the correct location
- Rebuild the app after adding config files

### Error: "Permission denied" in Firestore
- Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- Check rules in Firebase Console

### Error: "Function not found"
- Deploy functions: `firebase deploy --only functions`
- Check function status in Firebase Console

### App crashes on startup
- Check `firebase_options.dart` has correct values
- Verify package name matches in all places
- Clear app data and reinstall

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

Firebase offers a generous free tier:

**Free Tier Includes:**
- Authentication: Unlimited users
- Firestore: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
- Storage: 5GB storage, 1GB/day download
- Functions: 2M invocations/month
- Hosting: 10GB storage, 360MB/day bandwidth

For a small college (100-500 users), you'll likely stay within free limits.

**Estimated Costs if Exceeding Free Tier:**
- Light usage (500 students): $0-5/month
- Medium usage (1000 students): $5-20/month
- Heavy usage (2000+ students): $20-50/month

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit these files to git:**
   - `google-services.json`
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Firebase private keys
   
   (These are already in `.gitignore`)

2. **Enable App Check** (recommended for production):
   - Prevents abuse and unauthorized access
   - Setup in Firebase Console ‚Üí App Check

3. **Review Security Rules:**
   - Check `infra/firestore.rules`
   - Check `infra/storage.rules`
   - Customize as needed for your use case

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. Check Firebase documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs
2. Check Flutter Firebase docs: https://firebase.flutter.dev
3. Review error logs in Firebase Console
4. Create an issue in the GitHub repository

## üéâ What's Next?

After Firebase is connected:

1. ‚úÖ App will work fully with real database
2. ‚úÖ Users can register and login
3. ‚úÖ Notices and messages will be stored
4. ‚úÖ Push notifications will work
5. ‚úÖ File uploads will function

Then you can:
- Distribute APK to students and teachers
- Create admin accounts
- Add sample data
- Monitor usage in Firebase Console

---

**Note:** Firebase connection is a one-time setup that takes about 30-60 minutes. Once configured, the app will work seamlessly!
