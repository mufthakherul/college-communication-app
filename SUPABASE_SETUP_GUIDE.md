# Supabase Setup Guide for RPI Communication App

## ðŸš€ Connecting Your App to Supabase

The app has been migrated from Firebase to Supabase to eliminate costs. This guide will walk you through the setup process.

## Why Supabase?

Supabase provides similar features to Firebase but with a generous free tier that includes:
- **Authentication** - 50,000 monthly active users (free forever)
- **PostgreSQL Database** - 500 MB database (free forever)
- **Storage** - 1 GB file storage (free forever)
- **Edge Functions** - 500,000 invocations/month (free forever)
- **Real-time subscriptions** - Unlimited connections on free tier

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:
- A Supabase account (sign up at https://supabase.com)
- Flutter installed (for running the mobile app)
- Basic understanding of SQL (for database setup)

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://app.supabase.com
   - Sign in with your GitHub account or email

2. **Create a New Project:**
   - Click "New project"
   - Organization: Select or create an organization
   - Project name: `rpi-communication` (or your preferred name)
   - Database password: Create a strong password (save it!)
   - Region: Choose the closest region to your users
   - Click "Create new project"
   - Wait for project creation (~2 minutes)

### Step 2: Set Up Database Schema

1. **Open SQL Editor:**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

2. **Run Schema SQL:**
   - Open the file `infra/supabase_schema.sql` from this repository
   - Copy all the SQL code
   - Paste it into the Supabase SQL editor
   - Click "Run" or press `Ctrl+Enter`
   - Wait for completion message

3. **Run RLS Policies:**
   - Create a new query in SQL Editor
   - Open the file `infra/supabase_rls_policies.sql` from this repository
   - Copy all the SQL code
   - Paste it into the Supabase SQL editor
   - Click "Run" or press `Ctrl+Enter`
   - Wait for completion message

### Step 3: Configure Storage Buckets

1. **Create Storage Buckets:**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click "Storage" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - Create three buckets:
     - Name: `profile-images`, Public: Yes
     - Name: `notice-attachments`, Public: Yes
     - Name: `message-attachments`, Public: No

2. **Set Storage Policies:**
   For each bucket, click on it and go to "Policies" tab:
   
   **For profile-images:**
   ```sql
   -- Allow authenticated users to upload their own profile image
   CREATE POLICY "Users can upload profile images"
   ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
   WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
   
   -- Allow public read access
   CREATE POLICY "Public can view profile images"
   ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
   USING (bucket_id = 'profile-images');
   ```

   **For notice-attachments:**
   ```sql
   -- Allow teachers and admins to upload
   CREATE POLICY "Teachers and admins can upload notice attachments"
   ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
   WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
   
   -- Allow authenticated users to view
   CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view notice attachments"
   ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
   USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
   ```

### Step 4: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. **Get API Keys:**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click "Settings" (gear icon)
   - Click "API" in the left sidebar
   - You'll see:
     - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
     - **anon public** key (starts with `eyJ...`)

2. **Update App Configuration:**
   - Open `apps/mobile/lib/supabase_config.dart`
   - Replace the placeholder values:
     ```dart
     static const String supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_PROJECT_URL';
     static const String supabaseAnonKey = 'YOUR_ANON_KEY';
     ```

### Step 5: Set Up Authentication

1. **Configure Email Auth:**
   - In Supabase dashboard, go to "Authentication"
   - Click "Settings" â†’ "Email Auth"
   - Enable "Enable email confirmations" (recommended)
   - Disable "Enable email confirmations" for testing (optional)

2. **Configure Auth Redirects (Optional):**
   - Go to "Authentication" â†’ "URL Configuration"
   - Add your app's redirect URLs if needed

### Step 6: Run the Mobile App

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Test Authentication:**
   - Try registering a new user
   - Try logging in
   - Verify that the app connects successfully

### Step 7: Create First Admin User (Important!)

After the first user registers, you need to manually set them as admin:

1. **Go to Table Editor:**
   - In Supabase dashboard, click "Table Editor"
   - Select the "users" table
   - Find your user's row
   - Edit the "role" column to `admin`
   - Save

2. **Verify Admin Access:**
   - Log out and log back in
   - You should now have admin privileges

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

1. **Never Commit Secrets:**
   - Add `supabase_config.dart` to `.gitignore` if it contains real credentials
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Enable Email Verification:**
   - In production, always enable email verification
   - This prevents spam accounts

3. **Review RLS Policies:**
   - Test your Row Level Security policies
   - Ensure users can only access their own data

4. **Monitor Usage:**
   - Check your Supabase dashboard regularly
   - Monitor database size and API usage
   - Set up alerts for approaching limits

## ðŸ“Š Migrating Existing Data (Optional)

If you have existing Firebase data to migrate:

1. **Export from Firebase:**
   - Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore â†’ Export
   - Download your data as JSON

2. **Transform Data:**
   - Convert Firestore documents to PostgreSQL format
   - Adjust field names (snake_case instead of camelCase)
   - Convert Timestamps to ISO 8601 format

3. **Import to Supabase:**
   - Use the Table Editor to manually import small datasets
   - Or use SQL INSERT statements for larger datasets

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify your Supabase URL and anon key are correct
- Check that your project is not paused (free tier projects pause after 1 week of inactivity)
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

### Authentication Errors
- Verify email auth is enabled in Supabase dashboard
- Check that RLS policies are properly configured
- Ensure the users table was created correctly

### Database Errors
- Run the schema SQL again if tables are missing
- Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
- Check query syntax if custom queries fail

### Storage Errors
- Verify storage buckets exist
- Check storage policies are correctly configured
- Ensure file sizes are within limits
