## Testing Recommendations

Since this is a sandboxed environment without Flutter installed, the following should be tested on an actual device or emulator:

1. **Pull-to-Refresh:**
   - [ ] Test on Notices screen with data
   - [ ] Test on Notices screen when empty
   - [ ] Test on Messages screen with data
   - [ ] Test on Messages screen when empty

2. **Loading Skeletons:**
   - [ ] Verify skeleton appears during loading
   - [ ] Check skeleton matches actual content layout
   - [ ] Test on slow connections

3. **Error States:**
   - [ ] Trigger network error (turn off internet)
   - [ ] Test retry button functionality
   - [ ] Verify error messages are readable
   - [ ] Test error details dialog

4. **Privacy Policy:**
   - [ ] Click Privacy Policy link
   - [ ] Verify dialog scrolls properly
   - [ ] Check readability on small screens

5. **Login/Register Errors:**
   - [ ] Test with invalid email
   - [ ] Test with wrong password
   - [ ] Test with existing email (register)
   - [ ] Test with weak password
   - [ ] Verify error dialogs appear correctly
