# Security Policy

## Overview

The RPI Communication App implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. This document outlines the security measures in place and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### 1. Application Security

#### Code Obfuscation
- **ProGuard** enabled with aggressive optimization
- Custom obfuscation dictionary for enhanced protection
- Source file names and line numbers hidden
- String obfuscation to prevent static analysis
- Package repackaging with access modification

#### Runtime Protection
- Root/jailbreak detection (warning mode)
- Package name validation to prevent repackaging
- Backend configuration integrity checks
- Build integrity validation
- Security checks on every app startup

#### Secure Data Storage
- Sensitive data encrypted using secure storage service
- Authentication tokens stored securely
- Session data protected with encryption
- Key obfuscation to prevent easy extraction

### 2. Network Security

#### API Security
- HTTPS-only communication (enforced by Appwrite)
- Proper certificate validation
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time features
- API endpoint validation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Appwrite authentication with secure sessions
- Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student)
- Session tokens with secure storage
- Password requirements enforced
- Email verification support

### 3. Data Security

#### Database Security
- Collection-level permissions in Appwrite
- Row-level security policies
- User can only access their own data
- Role-based data access (RBAC)
- Audit logs for sensitive operations

#### File Storage Security
- Bucket-level permissions
- File size limits enforced
- File type validation
- User-owned files protected
- Automatic virus scanning (via Appwrite)

### 4. Production Hardening

#### Demo Mode
- **DISABLED** in production builds
- Prevents unauthorized testing access
- Only available in debug builds

#### Logging
- Debug logs removed in release builds
- No sensitive data in production logs
- Crash reports sanitized (via Sentry)

#### Build Configuration
- Release builds signed with secure keystore
- Keystore stored securely (not in repository)
- Build-time security validations
- ProGuard optimizations enabled

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets to repository**
   - Use environment variables
   - Store in secure configuration files
   - Add to .gitignore

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly check for updates
   - Review security advisories
   - Test updates thoroughly

3. **Review code for vulnerabilities**
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Implement proper input validation

4. **Secure API keys**
   - Use build-time configuration
   - Never hardcode in source
   - Rotate keys regularly

### For Administrators

1. **Appwrite Configuration**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Review permissions regularly
   - Monitor API usage

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit admin access
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Audit user roles regularly
   - Review access logs

3. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Regular database backups
   - Secure backup storage
   - Test recovery procedures
   - Document disaster recovery plan

## Known Limitations

### 1. Secure Storage Implementation
- **Status**: Basic XOR obfuscation
- **Impact**: Provides obfuscation, not cryptographic security
- **Recommendation**: For high-security needs, upgrade to flutter_secure_storage
- **Current Use**: Suitable for session tokens and non-critical data
- **Upgrade Path**: Replace with hardware-backed storage (Android KeyStore/iOS Keychain)

### 2. Package Name Validation
- **Status**: Placeholder implementation
- **Impact**: Cannot detect repackaged apps programmatically
- **Mitigation**: ProGuard obfuscation provides primary anti-repackaging protection
- **Recommendation**: Implement platform channels for full validation
- **Current Protection**: Code obfuscation makes repackaging difficult

### 3. Debugger Detection
- **Status**: Basic implementation
- **Impact**: May not detect sophisticated debuggers
- **Mitigation**: ProGuard obfuscation and root detection provide defense
- **Recommendation**: Implement platform-specific detection if needed
- **Current Protection**: Release mode disables most debugging features

### 4. Root/Jailbreak Detection
- **Status**: Warning only, not blocking
- **Reason**: Avoid false positives and UX issues
- **Recommendation**: Users warned of risks but can proceed

### 5. Certificate Pinning
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Reason**: Adds complexity, Appwrite uses valid certs
- **Future**: Can be added for advanced security
- **Current Protection**: HTTPS with certificate validation

### 6. Biometric Authentication
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Reason**: Focus on MVP features first
- **Future**: Planned for future release

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

✅ **App Repackaging**: Package name validation, integrity checks  
✅ **Code Reverse Engineering**: ProGuard obfuscation, custom dictionary  
✅ **Data Theft**: Encrypted storage, secure API calls  
✅ **Unauthorized Access**: Authentication, RBAC, session management  
✅ **Man-in-the-Middle**: HTTPS only, certificate validation  
✅ **SQL Injection**: Appwrite handles database queries securely  
✅ **XSS Attacks**: Input sanitization, secure rendering  

### Residual Risks

⚠️ **Rooted Devices**: Users warned but not blocked (UX consideration)  
⚠️ **Social Engineering**: User education needed  
⚠️ **Physical Access**: Device-level security (OS responsibility)  
⚠️ **Advanced APK Analysis**: ProGuard helps but not foolproof  

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **DO** email the security team privately
3. **INCLUDE**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

**Contact**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

### Security Advisory Process

1. **Report received** → Acknowledge and verify
2. **Severity assessed** → Assign CVSS score
3. **Fix developed** → Create patch in private branch
4. **Testing** → Verify fix doesn't break functionality
5. **Release** → Deploy to production
6. **Disclosure** → Public advisory after deployment
