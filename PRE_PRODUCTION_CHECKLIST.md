grep "_allowDemoMode = false" apps/mobile/lib/services/demo_mode_service.dart

# Verify ProGuard is enabled
grep "minifyEnabled true" apps/mobile/android/app/build.gradle

# Verify signing is configured
grep "signingConfig signingConfigs.release" apps/mobile/android/app/build.gradle

# Check for secrets in code
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" --include="*.dart" apps/mobile/lib/ | grep -v "// "
```

### Build Final Check
```bash
# Clean build
cd apps/mobile && flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Build release
flutter build apk --release

# Verify output
ls -lh build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Verify signature
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Backend Final Check
```bash
